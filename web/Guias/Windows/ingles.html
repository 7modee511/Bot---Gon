<p> This will automatically install everything you need and start by asking you to log in with a QR code or phone number. </p>

<h2> Restart the Bot </h2>
<p>To restart the bot, open UpdateAndStart.bat located in C:\ drive, and you’re set. </p>
<p>You can also open the folder location and start CMD from there, or directly from CMD with this command <code>cd %USERPROFILE%\mystic && npm start</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Windows has a limitation with the terminal, which pauses execution if minimized, and also shows random pop-ups when using ffmpeg.</p>
<p>To resolve this, you need to add a task in Task Scheduler.</p></blockquote>
<p>Open Task Scheduler and configure it with the following options:</p>
<p>Add a New Basic or Simple Task</p>
<p>Add a name, choose UpdateAndStart.bat, and set it to start at system startup with Advanced Settings</p>
<p>Run whether the user is logged on or not</p>
<p>Set it to not stop the task after 3 days and other preferred settings</p>
<p>Like this: </p>
